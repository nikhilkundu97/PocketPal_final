# PocketPal_final
If you're the sort of person who'd love to be as organized with 
personal expense tracking as you are with your expense reports at work, 
you'll love the totally free PocketPal app.

This is one of my final cource group project for my android class.
- Helps in monthly budgeting 
- Helps secure a profile
- Dynamic view of your spenditure

Features under construction
- Sync with your bank 
- Photo of your receipt 


More than happy if someone wants to contribute and make this app more 
productive.
